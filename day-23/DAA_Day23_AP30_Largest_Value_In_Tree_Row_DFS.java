/*
 * For X-Mas, santa claus is preparing a X-Mas Tree with set of Bulbs.
The bulbs are of different voltages, and preparation of tree as follows:
	- The bulbs are arranged in level-wise, levels are numbered from 0,1,2,3..
	  so on.
	- At level-0: There will be only one bulb as root bulb.,
	- From next level onwards, we can attach atmost two bulbs to left side,
	  and right side of every bulb in previous level.
	- The empty attachements in each level are indicated with -1. 

You will be given the root of the X-Mas Tree,
Your task is to findout the bulb with highest voltage in each level.

Implement the class Solution:
1.public List<Integer> maxInEachRow(BinaryTreeNode root): returns the list of integers.


Input Format:
-------------
A single line of space separated integers, voltages of the set of bulbs.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the list of voltages.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
2 4 3 6 4 -1 9

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[2, 4, 9]


Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 4 7 7 3 8 4 

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[3, 4, 8]
