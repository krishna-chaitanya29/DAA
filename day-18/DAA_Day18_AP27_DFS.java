/*
 * You are given a directed graph represented by vertices and edges. 
Your task is to implement Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal from a given starting vertex. 
The graph is represented using an adjacency list, and you need to traverse the graph starting from a specified vertex using an iterative approach (using a stack).

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer V, the number of vertices in the graph.
Line-2: An integer E, the number of edges in the graph.
Line3 to E: The next E lines each contain two integers source and destination, representing an edge from the source vertex to the destination vertex.
Line-E+1: The starting vertex S from which DFS traversal should begin.

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1" Print the vertices visited in DFS order starting from the given vertex S.

Constraints:
------------
*1 ≤ V ≤ 100
*0 ≤ E ≤ V * (V - 1)
*0 ≤ source, destination, S < V
