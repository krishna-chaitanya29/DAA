/*
 * You are tasked with building a protective boundary around a series of military camps situated along the border, represented as a binary tree structure. 
Each node in this binary tree represents a military camp identified by a unique ID. 
The main base camp is the root of this binary tree, with connections to other camps.

The goal is to help the Indian Army establish a secure boundary (S.H.I.E.L.D) around these camps. 
This boundary should be defined by the camps located at the edge of the binary tree, traced in an anti-clockwise direction, starting from the root.

The boundary should include:
	-Left Boundary: The camps forming the left edge of the tree, excluding leaf camps.
	-Leaf Nodes: All camps that are leaf nodes, traversed from left to right.
	-Right Boundary: The camps forming the right edge of the tree, excluding the root and leaf camps, added in reverse order.

You need to implement a method that outputs the IDs of the military camps located on this boundary.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Space-separated integers representing the IDs of the military camps in level order (top to bottom, left to right). Use -1 to denote a null or missing node.

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: A list of integers representing the military camp IDs that form the boundary, in anti-clockwise order.

Constraints:
------------
 * The tree may have between 1 and 10,000 nodes.
 * Camp IDs are unique integers.
 * -1 indicates a missing (null) node.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
5 2 4 7 9 8 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[5, 2, 7, 9, 8, 1, 4]

Sample Input-2:
---------------
11 2 13 4 25 6 -1 -1 -1 7 18 9 10

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[11, 2, 4, 7, 18, 9, 10, 6, 13]

Sample Input-3:
---------------
1

Sample Output-3:
----------------
[1]

NOTE:
------
The input should be parsed and constructed into a binary tree, and your code should handle large trees efficiently.
The boundary traversal should be handled with care, ensuring leaf nodes are only counted once in the output list.

Function Signature:
-------------------
public List<Integer> boundaryOfBinaryTree(BinaryTreeNode root)

This function will return a list of integers representing the boundary nodes of the tree in anti-clockwise order.
